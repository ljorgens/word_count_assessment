<h1>READ ME!</h1>

Hello fellow developer!

This read me will give you a better understanding of my word_count method and my sinatra website.

Setup

This Setup will only be for MACs because I dont know how to do it for Windows, Sorry PC users!

Specs:
I am using Mac OSX yosemite 10.10.1
and the text editor Sublime text 2
along with the terminal using ruby 1.9.2
and Safari web browser

Create a folder called_word count and copy the folders and names of the files in my repository into it.

You now should have a word_count folder with three folders and two files (not including the README).  Make sure Lib and spec have one file and views has 3 with all the right endings.

To begin you will need to open the terminal (make sure you are in the word_count folder)  and download the gems:
Sinatra
Sinatra-contrib
Sinatra/reloader
bundler

then type bundle in your terminal.  Now type $ ruby app.rb in your terminal.  This will open Sinatra and You are ready to go!

Next open your browser and type in local:4567 and the home page should come up.  And thats it play with the method to your hearts content!
